## ðŸ“ž Troubleshooting

**Q: Solutions look too short for 3-hour paper?**
A: These are condensed solutions. Exam answers need more detailed working shown.

**Q: How much detail should I write in exam?**
A: Show ALL major steps. Examiners award marks for method, not just answer.

**Q: Some formulas look unfamiliar?**
A: Check the derivations in Index-All-Solutions.md for complete explanations.

**Q: Can I use these directly in exam?**
A: No! Use as study aid only. Exams require showing YOUR working.

**Q: Are these official solutions?**
A: No, these are study solutions based on standard physics methods.
